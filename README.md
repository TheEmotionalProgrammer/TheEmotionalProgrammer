# Isidoro Tamassia
## PhD Researcher @ KU Leuven

I am a PhD researcher (Oct. 2025-present) at the DTAI group of KU Leuven University, supervised by Prof. Giuseppe Marra. My research interests lie at the intersection of NeuroSymbolic AI and Reinforcement Learning. 

I hold an MSc degree in Computer Science from TU Delft University, where I graduated under the supervision of Prof. Wendelin B√∂hmer. During my master's program, I had the opportunity to conduct research in both the theory and applications of Deep Reinforcement Learning. Previously, I obtained a BSc degree in Computer and Control Engineering from Universit√† di Roma 'La Sapienza'.
